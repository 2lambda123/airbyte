# Getting Started with Low-Code CDK

:warning: This framework is in [alpha](https://docs.airbyte.com/project-overview/product-release-stages/#alpha). It is still in active development and may include backward-incompatible changes. Please share feedback and requests directly with us at feedback@airbyte.io :warning:

## What connectors can I build using the low-code framework?

Refer to the REST API documentation for the source you want to build the connector for and answer the following questions:

- Does the REST API documentation show which HTTP method to use to retrieve data, and that the response is a JSON object?
- Do the queries return data synchronously
- Does the API support any of the following pagination mechanisms:
    - Offset count passed either by query params or request header
    - Page count passed either by query params or request header
    - Cursor field pointing to the URL of the next page of records
- Does the API support any of the following authentication mechanisms:
    - Endpoints that require authenticating using a query param or a HTTP header
    - Endpoints that require authenticating using Basic Auth over HTTPS
    - Endpoints that require authenticating using OAuth 2.0
- Is the schema of the API static?
- Does the endpoint have a strict rate limit?
    - Throttling is not supported, but the connector can use exponential backoff to avoid API bans in case it gets rate limited. This can work for APIs with high rate limits, but not for those that have strict limits on a small time-window.
- Are the following features sufficient to implement your connector?

If the answer to all questions is yes, you can use the low-code framework to build a connector for the source.
If not, you can use the CDK, and [request the feature](../../contributing-to-airbyte/README.md#requesting-new-features) and use the [Python CDK](../cdk-python/README.md).

## Prerequisites

- An API key for the source you want to build a connector for
- Python >= 3.9
- Docker
- NodeJS

## Overview of the process

1. Generate the API key for the source you want to build a connector for
2. Set up the project on your local machine
3. Set up your local development environment
4. Update the connector spec and configâ€‹uration
5. Update the connector definition
6. Test the connector
7. Add the connector to the Airbyte platform

For a step-by-step tutorial, refer to the [Getting Started tutorial](./tutorial/0-getting-started.md).

## Configuring the YAML file

The low-code framework involves editing a boilerplate YAML file. The general structure of the YAML file is as follows:

```yaml
version: "0.1.0"
definitions:
  <key-value pairs defining objects which will be reused in the YAML connector>
streams:
  <list stream definitions>
check:
  <definition of connection checker>
```

| `check`                                                | Describes how to test the connection to the source by trying to read a record from a specified list of streams and failing if no records could be read                                                                                                                                                                                            |

*Tip: Streams define the schema of the data to sync, as well as how to read it from the underlying API source. A stream generally corresponds to a resource within the API. They are analogous to tables for a relational database source.*

For each stream, configure the following components:
