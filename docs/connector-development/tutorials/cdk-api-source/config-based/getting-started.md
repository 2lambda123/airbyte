# Getting Started
TODO: Some intro...

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9
- Docker
- NodeJS (TODO: Is this still required?)
FIXME: I think we also need venv. Does this come by default?

## Exchange Rates API Setup
For this guide we will be making API calls to the Exchange Rates API. In order to generate the API access key that will be used by the new connector, you will have to follow steps on the Exchange Rates API by signing up for the Free tier plan. Once you have an API access key, you can continue with the guide.


## Next Steps
Next, we'll create a Source using the connector generator.
