# Secoda API

This document outlines how to set up the Secoda API source connector in Airbyte.

## Sync overview

This source can sync data from the [Secoda API](https://docs.secoda.co/secoda-api). At present, this connector only supports full refresh syncs meaning that each time you use the connector, it will sync all available records from scratch. Please use it cautiously if you expect your API to have a lot of records.

## This Source Supports the Following Streams

* collections
