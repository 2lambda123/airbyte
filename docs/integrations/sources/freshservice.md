## Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Freshservice Source connector in Airbyte. You need to provide these pieces of information to configure this connector:

* Freshservice Account
* Freshservice API Key
* Freshservice Domain Name
* Replication Start Date

### Step 1: Obtain Your Freshservice Domain Name

The Freshservice Domain Name is the URL you use to access your Freshservice instance. It should be in the format `mydomain.freshservice.com`. Make a note of your domain name as you will need it to set up the connector.

### Step 2: Obtain Your Freshservice API Key

To obtain your Freshservice API Key, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Freshservice account.
2. Click on your profile picture located in the top-right corner of your Freshservice dashboard, and then click on `Profile settings`.
3. Scroll down to the `Your API Key` section. You will find your API key here.
4. Make a note of your API key as you will need it to set up the connector. 

For more information, refer to the Freshservice documentation on [Authentication](https://api.freshservice.com/#authentication).

### Step 3: Determine Your Replication Start Date

The Replication Start Date is a UTC date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z`. Data before this date will not be replicated in Airbyte. Choose an appropriate date and time to start replicating your data.

### Step 4: Configure the Freshservice Source Connector

Now that you have the necessary information, follow these steps to configure the Freshservice Source Connector in Airbyte:

1. Enter your Freshservice Domain Name in the `Domain Name` field.
2. Enter your Freshservice API Key in the `API Key` field.
3. Enter your Replication Start Date in the `Start Date` field using the format provided.

Once you have entered the required information, you can proceed with setting up the Freshservice Source connector in Airbyte.
