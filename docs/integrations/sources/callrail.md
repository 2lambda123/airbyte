1. In the Airbyte connector configuration form, enter the API Key and Account ID obtained in the previous steps, and the start date you chose.
2. Run the connector by clicking the **Test Connection** button to verify if the provided credentials are valid and the connection is successful.
3. If the connection test is successful, click on **Save & Continue** to complete the setup process.

Having completed these steps, the CallRail Source connector in Airbyte should now be successfully configured with the necessary credentials and start date. Airbyte will use this information to fetch data from your CallRail account.
