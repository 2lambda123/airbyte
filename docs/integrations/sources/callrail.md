## Getting started

### Requirements

To set up the CallRail source connector in Airbyte, you will need the following:

* Access to a CallRail account
* A CallRail API Token, which can be created and obtained by following the instructions outlined in the [CallRail API documentation](https://apidocs.callrail.com/#authentication)

### Connection steps

1. In the Airbyte UI, navigate to the CallRail configuration form.
2. Enter a nickname for the new connection.
3. Enter the `api_key` and `account_id` associated with your CallRail account. The `api_key` serves as the authentication token to access the CallRail account via API. The `account_id` can be found in the URL of your CallRail account dashboard.
4. Enter the start date that data should be synced from. The date should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
5. Click "Save" to save the changes to the configuration.

For detailed instructions on setting up your CallRail API token and finding your `account_id`, please refer to the [CallRail API documentation](https://apidocs.callrail.com/#authentication).
